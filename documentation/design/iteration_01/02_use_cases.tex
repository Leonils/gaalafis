\section{Use cases}

In normal use, two types of actors can interact with the system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Developers} are the people that use the system to store and retrieve files. They are authenticated and authorized by the system.
    \item \textbf{Administrators} are the people or system that manage the system.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, any non authenticated user is considered harmful and all interactions must be rejected.

The figure \ref{fig:use_cases} shows the use cases of these three actors of the system.
