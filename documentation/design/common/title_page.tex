    \begin{abstract} 
        This report presents the conception of a system designed to enhance Git, a distributed version control system. The system's primary objectives include centralized authentication and authorization, efficient management of large files using Git-lfs, and a focus on reusability to accommodate diverse organizational needs. This system was developed as a side project during the final year of a software engineering program at CentralSup√©lec engineering school, and was a good opportunity to apply the methods and techniques learned during the program. The report is a working document, and will be iteratively improved as the project progresses.
